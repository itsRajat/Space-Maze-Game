# Treasure-Maze-Game
A fun maze game built using Vanilla JavaScript &amp; Matter.js. Take the Astronaut back to Earth before the Oxygen runs out to win. You gotta be fast, because the clock is ticking and the whole planet depends on you for the information you found on Mars. Good luck.

This is the first basic version, will probably turn this into an Astronaut/Space style maze game with a timer & varied difficulty levels in future.
