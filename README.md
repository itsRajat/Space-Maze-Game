# Treasure-Maze-Game
A fun maze game built using Vanilla JavaScript &amp; Matter.js. Take the Astronaut back to Earth before the Oxygen runs out to win. You gotta be fast, because the clock is ticking and the whole planet depends on you for that top secret information you found on Mars. Good luck.

Note: The background music might not work if you're using a browser that doesn't allow Autoplay.

V2 -> Changed the theme of the game from Cave to Space-based and added a timer w/ losing conditions. Will probably add different difficulty levels in future.
